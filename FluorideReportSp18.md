## Abstract
The Fluoride subteam seeks to develop a sustainable, inexpensive fluoride removal system for implementation in upcoming AguaClara plants located in India. Using the apparatus developed by previous semesters, the team continued running experiments testing how various concentrations of PACl affect fluoride removal. However, complications with calibrating the fluoride probe required the team to shift its goals to designing a lab scale, gravity-powered system.  The team is now working to finalize a design and to begin construction of the new, electricity-free apparatus.  Once the system is functional, the team plans on running experiments to test its fluoride removal capabilities.

## Introduction
With 85% of its drinking water sourced from groundwater, India is the largest user of groundwater in the world. In stark contrast to tap water sources in the United States that are supplemented with fluoride, India’s groundwater sources often display excess levels of fluoride due to rocks in aquifers that leak large amounts of fluoride into the water. Consequently, villagers  who rely on these well sources for water are at a high risk of overexposure to fluoride. The prevalence of dental fluorosis, an indicator of excessive fluoride concentrations, differs across India, but has been shown to range from 13-91 percent depending on the age group in question and the water source supplying the state or municipality [(Arlappa et al., 2013)](http://www.ijrdh.com/files/11.Fluorosis.pdf).

In accordance with AguaClara's mission to create affordable, reliable, and sustainable water treatment solutions, the goal of the subteam is to treat groundwater with excessive fluoride concentrations. Teams from previous semesters analyzed the efficiency of fluoride removal by passing a coagulant, polyaluminum chloride (PACl), and a solution of fluoride through a sand filter. However, the sand filter was an inefficient method of removal because of the buildup of headloss from particles deposited in the sand filter that eventually prevented water from flowing through [(Dao et el., 2015)](https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/AGUACLARA/Fluoride). Thus, instead of using a traditional sand filter, the team researched a similar relationship between PACl and fluoride via a floc blanket reactor. In the floc blanket reactor, flocs of PACl and clay adsorbed the fluoride from the influent water. The flocs then overflowed into a floc weir as the floc blanket grew and the purified water flowed out the top of the reactor. This reactor was modeled after the floc blanket, floc weir, and plate settlers setup in the sedimentation tank of a typical AguaClara water treatment plant. The team expected that the floc blanket reactor would be able to remove fluoride with a significantly higher efficiency than the sand filter from previous semesters and could run for extended periods of time due to the absence of headloss buildup in the reactor. The flocs in the floc blanket could exit the floc weir while the fluoride in the sand filter would build up and saturate the sand in a short amount of time [(Longo et al., 2016)](https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/AGUACLARA/Fluoride) [(Cheng et al., 2016)](https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/AGUACLARA/Fluoride).

Last semester, the subteam continued the research performed from the summer of 2017, hoping to achieve high fluoride removal with the addition of clay. After switching to a new reactor designed by the High Rate Sedimentation team, the Fluoride subteam tested different concentrations of PACl and different upflow velocities with the goal of lowering the fluoride concentration to 1.5 $mg/L$ [(Longo et al., 2017)](https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/AGUACLARA/Fluoride). This semester's team was hoping to continue these tests and recreate the adsorption model developed last semester using tap water as opposed to deionized water standards. After discovering issues with the fluoride probe, the team altered its direction and began to design a gravity-powered system. If possible, a fluoride removal system that does not require electricity would be very beneficial to the communities in India that AguaClara plans to serve. Once this system has been constructed, the team can begin testing its ability to remove fluoride.

##Literature Review
####*Fluoride Limitations and Hazards*

Over-consumption of fluoride can lead to arthritis, dental fluorosis, crippling fluorosis, bone deformation and ligament calcification [(Roholm, 1937)](http://cof-cof.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Roholm-Fluorine-Intoxication-A-Clinical-Hygienic-Study-Copenhagen-Denmark-1937.pdf). Fluoride can cause irritation through inhalation, digestion, and touch, and can cause damage to both eyes and exposed skin [(NJ Department of Health, 2010)](http://nj.gov/health/eoh/rtkweb/documents/fs/1699.pdf). Though there isn’t an established “average” level of fluoride in India, as literature suggests that fluoride levels are seldom above 5 mg/L in groundwater. However, in the remote Karbi Anglong district of India, fluoride levels range from 5-23 mg/L causing severe anemia, stiff joints, painful and restricted movement, mottled teeth and kidney failure [(LeChevallier and Au, 2004)](http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/9241562552/en/).

According to the National Research Council (NRC), the maximum contaminant level (MCL) of fluoride in drinking water is 4 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$. However, a secondary limit of 2 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$ has been established by the EPA to avoid potential cosmetic effects such as tooth and skin discoloration. The World Health Organization (WHO) established a safe upper limit of 1.5 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$ to avoid all potential risks of fluoride consumption. The team will be striving towards the WHO guideline of 1.5 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$ of fluoride this semester by designing and experimenting with the floc blanket reactor and manipulating the ratios and concentrations of PACl and clay in the system.
####*Polyaluminum Chloride (PACl) and Fluoride Removal*
One common type of water treatment consists of a series of coagulation, flocculation, and clarification. During coagulation, raw water is mixed with a positively charged coagulant (typically an aluminum salt or iron salt), altering or destabilizing any negatively charged particles or dissolved and colloidal contaminants [(EPA, 2016)](https://iaspub.epa.gov/tdb/pages/general/home.do). Depending on the dose of coagulant, there are two methods of particle destabilization. The first, charge neutralization, occurs with a lower coagulant dose and happens as the negative colloids are attracted to the positively charged coagulant particles. The second method, sweep flocculation, requires a high coagulant dose and transpires when the contaminants are caught by precipitates as they settle in the suspension [(EPA, 2016)](https://iaspub.epa.gov/tdb/pages/general/home.do). The destabilized particles then proceed through flocculation, where additional mixing increases the rate of particle collision, forming larger precipitates. Following the formation of flocs, clarification removes the agglomerated particles through sedimentation or other removal processes [(EPA, 2016)](https://iaspub.epa.gov/tdb/pages/general/home.do).

In recent years, polymerized forms of aluminum salts have been used increasingly to replace standard aluminum salt coagulants [(Ingallinella and Pacini, 2001)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10934529.2011.598835?scroll=top&needAccess=true). Polyaluminum chloride, a partially hydrolyzed aluminum salt, is one of the most widely used, as it delivers results similar to aluminum sulfate (alum) coupled with a polyelectrolyte [(Ingallinella and Pacini, 2001)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10934529.2011.598835?scroll=top&needAccess=true). The main advantages of using polyaluminum chloride instead of alum include a reduction in sulfates added to treated water, lower sludge production, reduced odor problems, and higher overall removal efficiency [(Gebbie, 2001)](http://wioa.org.au/conference_papers/2001/pdf/paper6.pdf). In the Daylesford Water Filtration Plant, a dose of 45 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$ of alum was required to produce potable water, while only 12 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$ of  PACl were required. Additionally, PACl is advantageous in particulate removal because its hydrolyzed state allows for it to be less affected than typical aluminum salts when temperature conditions are inconsistent [(EPA, 2016)](https://iaspub.epa.gov/tdb/pages/general/home.do). Furthermore, PACl has a broader range of raw water pH in which it is an effective coagulant. It shows stable turbidity removal from 5.0-8.0 pH, compared to a range of 6.0-7.0 pH for both $\rm{AlCl_3}$ and $\rm{Al_2(SO_4)}$  [(Yang et al., 2010)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20188465). For the removal of fluoride, PACl has been found to be the most effective with pH values between 5.2 and 6.2 [(EPA, 2016)](https://iaspub.epa.gov/tdb/pages/general/home.do).

Several techniques currently use PACl to reduce high fluoride levels. The Nalgonda technique is a popular fluoride removal method that involves a combination of rapid mixing, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration and disinfection. However,  fluoride removal is usually done through co-precipitation  [(Bailey and Fawell, 2004)](http://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/43514), which has traditionally been done using aluminum sulfate, but more recent experiments have proven that PACl can be an effective substitute [(Kumbhar and Salkar, 2014)](http://www.ijetae.com/files/Volume4Issue10/IJETAE_1014_22.pdf). The Nalgonda technique typically utilizes a "batch filtration" method, where large quantities of water are treated in buckets. This technique does not utilize continuous flow, and requires a series of treatments to obtain decontaminated water for extended periods of time. For this reason, the Nalgonda technique has been largely introduced as a household treatment method, and has been introduced to various Indian villages, including those in Nalgonda and in the state of Telangana. It is also currently being studied at the pilot scale in Kenya, Senegal and Tanzania [(Dahi et al., 1996)](https://wedc-knowledge.lboro.ac.uk/resources/conference/22/Dahi.pdf).  In addition to the restrictions implied by batch treatment, the Nalgonda method requires a high dosage of aluminum sulfate to aggregate with fluoride and precipitate. A study conducted by [(Dahi et al., 1996)](https://wedc-knowledge.lboro.ac.uk/resources/conference/22/Dahi.pdf) suggests that 13 $\mathrm{\frac{g}{L}}$ alum (1.2 $\mathrm{\frac{g}{L}}$ as Al) is needed for the Nalgonda method to effectively treat fluoride levels between 9 and 13 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$. Despite the high concentrations of coagulant, the fluoride residual in the test was still unable to meet the WÂHO safety guidelines of 1.5 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$ of fluoride. The high dose of aluminum sulfate also leaves high sulfate residuals in the water, which causes taste and odor issues [(Bailey and Fawell, 2004)](http://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/43514).

In regards to other filtration methods, a study by Inganiella achieved 33.3% removal of fluoride using a combination of a gravel pre-filter and a sand rapid filter to capture granules of fluoride, PACl, NaClO and $SO_4H_2$ [(Ingallinella and Pacini, 2001)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10934529.2011.598835?scroll=top&needAccess=true).


####*Floc Blankets*
Floc blankets develop when vertical flow sedimentation tanks form a fluidized bed of particles like the one in the figure below that then facilitates particle removal by “increasing particle-particle interactions that lead to flocculation and filtration occurring in the floc blanket” [(Hurst, 2010)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.849.6127&rep=rep1&type=pdf).

<img src="https://github.com/AguaClara/fluoride/blob/master/fluoride%20report/Flocs_in_Reactor.jpg?raw=true" height=400, width=300>


The process of forming flocs requires both the precipitation of aluminum hydroxide from the coagulant and the contact with raw water colloidal particles [(Hurst, 2010)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.849.6127&rep=rep1&type=pdf). Once the combination of precipitation and mixing forms small particles, these new flocs collide to form larger, more porous flocs that can then be used for clarification [(Hurst, 2010)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.849.6127&rep=rep1&type=pdf).

This floc blanket clarification is considered hindered settling, which is a form of sedimentation [(Gregory et al., 1996)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-61196-4_2). Sedimentation processes are characterized by the removal of suspended particles, e.g. flocs, sand, and clay, from water. Removal is possible due to the differences in density between water and the suspended particles, but is also dependent on the size of the suspended particles, water temperature, turbulence, stability of flow, bottom scour, and flocculation [(Sun, 2004)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/0471623571.ch11/summary). Floc blanket clarification, however, is primarily governed by upflow velocity of the water and by floc concentration [(Gregory et al., 1996)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-61196-4_2). The relationship between upflow velocity, concentration and water quality can be combined into the mass rate of settling, which is equal to the product of upflow velocity and concentration. Within a range of mass fluxes, a distinct interface is established between clear water and the floc blanket and thus one can deduce appropriate values of velocity and floc concentration.  At concentrations above that ideal mass flux range, the aggregation of flocs becomes thick enough that compression settling occurs. At concentrations below that appropriate range, flocs are not inhibited by other particles and a suspension with different settling velocities is formed [(Gregory et al., 1996)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-61196-4_2).


Floc blanket clarification is used to purify water in many ways around the world. In Taiwan, a process of pre-sedimentation, floc blanket clarification, and sand filtration is used to reduce 100 NTU water down to potable levels [(Lin et al., 2004)](https://ascelibrary-org.proxy.library.cornell.edu/doi/abs/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9372(2004)130:12(1481)). Floc blankets have also been used extensively to purify water of algae, protozoa and specific virus strains [(LeChavallier and Au, 2004)](http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/9241562552/en/). Therefore, it is believed that the adaptability of this method in conjunction with the use of PACl would allow for effective fluoride removal.

####*Coagulation*
Many sources have shown that PACl seems to be the optimal coagulant for the purposes of removing arsenic and fluoride from influent water. [(Zonoozi et al, 2009)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19381000). PACl has been and continues to be used as the most common form of dye removal at the industrial scale. Despite its cost, a main reason as to why PACl is so popular as opposed to other coagulants is that PACl does not cause any leeching of hazardous chemicals into the water from dye decomposition [(Golob et al, 2005)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143720804002724). A drawback of PACl is that once its coagulation capabilities are saturated, the dye coagulation drops drastically while other coagulants are able to reach a maximum capacity and plateau. The team has been using PACl as the coagulant since the start of the project. Thus, for the sake of consistency in results, PACl will be used until the reactor design can be optimized. Only once the reactor is optimized can coagulant experimentation be considered.

####*Countercurrent Flow Theory*
The use of countercurrent flow for separation of clean and dirty water is a major component of the Countercurrent Stacked Floc Blanket Reactor (CSFBR) system. Countercurrent flow is a common concept that can be observed in biological systems such as the kidneys. Countercurrent parallel vessels exchange NaCl through passive diffusion to remove excess NaCl from fluid that would be circulated throughout the body [(Kokko and Rector, 1972)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/18508204_Kokko_JP_Rector_FC_Jr_Countercurrent_multiplication_system_without_active_transport_in_inner_medulla_Kidney_Int_2_214-223). The CSFBR utilized the concept of countercurrent flow to decrease the concentration of dissolved species in reactor 1 by moving flocs from an area of low concentration of dissolved species (reactor 2) to a high concentration of dissolved species (reactor 1). This is accomplished by removing the flocs from reactor 2 using the floc hopper and directing them to the influent stream of reactor 1. Consequently, the effluent flocs from reactor 1 will be more concentrated with the dissolved species and the system will produce less waste per mass of contaminant removed.

## Previous Work
In the spring of 2016, the team analyzed data that suggested that the sand filter system was inefficient and decided to move towards the idea of a single floc blanket reactor [(Longo, 2016)](https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/AGUACLARA/Fluoride) Although the sand filter provided cheaper, more adequate removal of fluoride per milligram of PACl used, a key issue that arose with the sand filter was the system run time. The sand filter became saturated with PACl and fluoride too quickly and the head loss built up rapidly. In a matter of a couple of hours, the floc blanket was completely saturated to the point where it was no longer efficient or providing adequate removal of fluoride. Consequently, the system had to be backwashed too frequently to be an effective process (about every couple hours). On a much larger scale, such as a full size plant, a reduction in time to failure would require more maintenance than is feasible. In order to address this, the team fabricated a new reactor as seen in the figure below mirroring that of the floc blanket and plate settlers in the current AguaClara plants. The team set up a new apparatus fit with stock tanks, a reactor, a turbidimeter, a flocculator, and stock and waste pumps, referencing research  previously conducted on the relationship between the amount of coagulant added and head loss accumulation [(Dao, 2015)](https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/AGUACLARA/Fluoride).

<img src="https://github.com/AguaClara/fluoride/blob/master/fluoride%20report/Old_Setup.jpg?raw=true" height=300, width=400>

The team then developed a MathCad file to calculate flow rates of pumps from a given set of parameters including upflow velocity, tubing diameters, and reactor concentrations. The team also created a ProCoDA method file to turn the flow rates into RPMs for the pumps so that the process of changing PACl and fluoride concentrations within the reactor was more user-friendly.

After the calculations and fabrication were completed, the team was able to successfully create a floc blanket composed of clay and PACl. When the floc blanket had stabilized, the team tested the system with fluoride. By performing short term, 10 hours tests, the team was able to remove around 85\% of the initial concentration of fluoride. The final concentration of fluoride in the effluent was lower than the WHO regulation, indicating that the floc blanket reactor was a viable method to remove fluoride [(Longo, 2016)](https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/AGUACLARA/Fluoride).

In an effort to improve reactor efficiency, the team fabricated an entirely transparent version of the reactor, where the important contact points (the floc weir and the bend to the tube settler) were visible so that interactions occurring in those areas could be analyzed. The team then used this reactor at an EPA competition to analyze red dye in place of fluoride and found that it was a successful dye removal apparatus. Finally, the team performed some initial jar tests which suggested that the use of clay may not be necessary for the removal of fluoride [(Longo, 2016)](https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/AGUACLARA/Fluoride). These tests included putting PACl and fluoride into a beaker to mix for 5 minutes then settle for 15 minutes. Then, the surface water was tested for fluoride to reveal low levels of fluoride. If this was experimentally verified, then the elimination of clay from the system design could reduce the operating cost needed for fluoride removal.

In the fall of 2016, the team fabricated a new bottom insert to prevent the accumulation of flocs that clogged the bottom of the reactor. The newly fabricated geometry with a smooth sloped bottom allowed for gradual flow expansion and the recirculation of the flocs that would have settled to the bottom of the reactor with the old bottom geometry as shown in the figure below.

<img src="https://github.com/AguaClara/fluoride/blob/master/fluoride%20report/Reactor_Bottom.png?raw=true" height=400, width=350>

Various concentrations of dye were tested (from 25 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$ to 100 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$) using a 1:1 PACl to dye ratio to see whether higher concentrations of dye would clog the reactor. However, even though increasing the concentration of dye increased the density of the floc blanket, the reactor did not clog and the bottom insert proved to be successful for these tests [(Longo, 2016)](https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/AGUACLARA/Fluoride).

The team also determined the minimum length of the reactor needed to save resources and space. A shorter reactor, with a height of 5 cm below the weir, was tested with concentrations of 25 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$, 50 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$, and 100 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$ of dye. Although the floc blankets reached a short term steady state height of around 20-30 cm,  the reactor failed in the long term as flocs built up and went through the tube settler to the turbidimeter in the long term. This suggested that there was a minimum height that a floc blanket would reach; thus the shorter reactor system was not feasible. [(Longo, 2016)](https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/AGUACLARA/Fluoride).

During the final portion of the semester, the subteam performed 24-hour experiments with the longer reactor in order to compare its results with those of the CSFBR subteam. The CSFBR subteam had hypothesized that a species removal system composed of two reactors in series could lead to cleaner water than the Fluoride team's single reactor system. During each iteration, the two teams ran each system for approximately twenty four hours with the same red dye and PACl concentrations. However, the results of these experiments were inconclusive because the CSFBR team found that PACl would clog their system midway through each experiment; rendering the reactors incapable of further purification [(Dokko, 2016)](https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/AGUACLARA/Countercurrent+Stacked+Floc+Blanket+Reactor?preview=%2F327614518%2F340898600%2FCSFBRFinalReportFall2016.pdf). Thus, past semesters' subteams sought to reexamine the benefits of reactors in series versus a single reactor and to conclude which system yields the lowest effluent concentrations of red dye and fluoride.

Over the summer of 2017, tests performed during the previous semester were repeated in order to finally determine whether the second reactor in series made enough significant improvements to be implemented on a larger scale. A new fluoride probe was purchased, and experiments conducted on this probe showed that a plant using Spring 2017's parameters could produce effluent water with as low as 0.05 mg/L, significantly below the WHO's standards. However, clay that remained in the effluent caused turbidity to often rise above 5 NTU. In consideration of this turbidity and as an effort to lower the number of resources needed to implement the reactor, it was determined that clay needed to be eliminated from the system. Additionally, the unusually high PACl dosage of 25 g/L needed to be lowered. While no data was collected that definitively pointed to using one or two reactors, the team tentatively hypothesized that the second reactor would not justify the added expenses when built on a larger scale. However, once the reagent parameters were optimized, further tests and a cost analysis could be conducted to verify this.

As research conducted over summer 2017 suggested, last semester's team removed the addition of clay to the system and sought to determine the optimal PACl concentration for high fluoride removal rates [(Longo, 2017)](https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/AGUACLARA/Fluoride). Initial tests showed that the reactors would fail within 10 hours due to sludge buildup regardless of PACl concentration, so the team switched to a new reactor designed by the summer 2017 High Rate Sedimentation team. The new reactor increased the time to failure and allowed for higher upflow velocities. After running various tests, the team determined an upflow velocity of 1.5 mm/s was the best way to reduce sludge buildup. The team then ran experiments looking at  the effects of increasing PACl concentration on removal rates. Data collected from these experiments was used to create an adsorption model that could be used to calculate the necessary PACl dosage for a desired effluent fluoride concentration. After creating the adsorption model, the team observed a significant difference in the fluoride probe readings for tap water versus the readings in deionized water. The findings suggested that the amount of fluoride ions in tap water is actually higher than the readings from the fluoride probe state. Therefore, the team decided the adsorption model was incorrect and should be remade taking this discrepancy into consideration.

## Future Work
Describe your plan of action for the next several weeks of research. Detail the next steps for this team. How can AguaClara use what you discovered for future projects? Your suggestions for challenges for future teams are most welcome. Should research in this area continue?

The team is currently still in the process of calculating all the parameters necessary for the design of the lab scale, gravity powered fluoride removal system. More specifically, there are a few additional details with respect to where the height of coagulant stock tanks are placed in order to get the desired concentration of coagulant into the system. In order to do this calculation, the team has been working on python code employing functions in the aide_design package. However, the values calculated by the aide_design functions currently do not directly coincide with the old Mathcad functions, and it is not known where the inconsistencies lie between the two programs.
The team is also working on trying to use Fusion 360 to create a drawing of the designed process. In the coming weeks, the team will continue to work on the Fusion 360 drawings as well as continue to work on the python code and calculations. Following this, the team will build the designed set up in the lab space and begin testing.

# Manual
The goal of this section is to provide all of the guidance that would be necessary for a future team to pick up your work where you left off. Please try to be thorough and put yourselves in the shoes of a newcomer to the project. Below are some recommended sections, but the manual will likely take a slightly different form for each team.

## Fabrication Details
Include any information related to the fabrication of equipment, experimental apparatuses, or technologies. Include the purpose of each step and the fabrication methods used. Reference appropriate safety precautions.

## Experimental Methods
### Set-up
Step 1.
* Put tasks in a sequential order.
* It is okay to have sub-lists.

### Variables
$g$: gravity
$\sigma$: dispersion
$a$: amplitude
$h$: water depth
$H$: distance from wave crest to trough (2$a$)
$T$: wave period
$\lambda$: wavelength
$k$: wavenumber
$c_p$: celerity (wave phase speed)
$P$: pressure
$F$: force
$u$, $w$: x-velocity, z-velocity components



$$ P_1 + \rho g \Delta h_1+ \frac{1}{2}\rho {v_1}^2 = P_2 + \rho g \Delta h_2+ \frac{1}{2}\rho {v_2}^2+ h_f $$

We can cancel out our pressure teams since the inflow and outflow are both to the atmosphere, as well as the velocity at point 1 since the constant head valve guarantees no change in velocity in this tank. Therefore the Bernoulli equation becomes the following:
$$ \rho g \Delta h_1 = \rho g \Delta h_2+ \frac{1}{2}\rho {v_2}^2+ h_f
$$
We can input our known variables for Volumetric Flow (Q), Area of our tubes (A), the gravitational constant (g), and $h_1$ as our reference point making it zero.
$$ Q= .76 * {10}^-6 \frac{{m}^3}{s}$$
$$ g = 9.8 \frac{m}{{s}^2} $$
$$ d = \frac {3}{16} in * 2.54 \frac {cm}{in} * \frac {1 m}{100 cm} $$
$$ A = \pi * {(\frac {d}{2})^2}$$
$$ v = \frac{Q}{A} $$

Resulting in this equation:

$$ \Delta h_2 = \frac {\frac{v^2}{16}}{2g} + h_f $$
%$$ \Delta h_2 = \frac {.04266 \frac{m}{{s}^2}}{2*g}$$
$$ h_f = \frac {L}{v} * \nu * \frac{G_{coil}^2}{g} $$
$$ \nu = \frac{\mu}{\rho} = 8.9861*10^-7 \frac{m^2}{s}$$
$$ L = 9.43m $$
$$ G_{coil} = $$

$$ \Delta h = h_f + h_2 $$



Using the same principle as the water flow, we can calculate the height difference we would need for a correct flow of coagulant.
