## Abstract
Briefly summarize your previous work, goals and objectives, what you have accomplished, and future work. (100 words max)

## Introduction
Explain how the completion of your challenge will affect AguaClara and the mission of providing safe drinking water (or sustainable wastewater treatment!). If this is a continuing team, how will your contribution build upon previous research? What needs to be further discovered or defined? If this is a new team, what prompted the inclusion of this team?

The recent expansion of AguaClara technology to new places around the world, like India, has uncovered new challenges and prompted new goals for AguaClara. In Honduras, where the majority of AguaClara plants have been constructed, the source of water designated for filtration comes from surface waters such as rivers and lakes. These waters typically have a high amount of particulate matter and as a result also carry biological contaminants. However, in India 85% of the population drinks groundwater extracted from wells. Contrast to surface water sources like in Honduras, groundwater contains nearly no particulate matter as many of the particles have been naturally filtered out as the water percolates through the soil and rock material. While this natural filtration process is capable of removing particulate matter it also offers the opportunity for minerals and metals to leach into the water. The kind of mineral and metal deposits depend heavily on the types of parent rock material and soils found in the region. India lies on what is known as one of the Fluoride Belts which are expanses of land that are geologically fluoride rich and have a much greater capacity to leach fluoride into the groundwater. According to the World Health Organization one of these belts stretches from Syria through Jordan, Egypt, Libya, Algeria, Sudan, and Kenya while another starts in Turkey and goes through Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, India, Northern Thailand, and China (2016).

There are a number of public health implications associated with both underconsumption and overconsumption of fluoride. Fluoride is a common additive to municipal water systems in places like the United States where there is little to no fluoride naturally present in the water. Fluoride is added in order to prevent the onset of dental caries. New York City for example adds fluoride to its water supply in order to achieve a concentration of 0.7mg/L in their effluent supply (NYC DEP, 2016). 0.7mg/L is the agreed upon recommendation for fluoride by the American Dental Association for the prevention of dental cavities (ADA, 2017). However, the World Health Organization has set the upper limit for fluoride in drinking water at 1.5 mg/L in order to prevent the onset of dental fluorosis

## Literature Review and Previous Work
Discuss what is already known about your research area based on both external work and that of past AguaClara Teams. Connect your objectives with what is already known and explain what additional contribution you intend to make. Make sure to add APA formatted in-text citations. If you mention the author(s) in your sentence, you can simply give the year of publication.[(Logan et. al. 1987)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/25043431.pdf?acceptTC=true)


## Methods

### Experimental Apparatus

The experimental apparatus included pumps, a coiled flocculator, and a sedimentation tube. Fluoride and coagulant

![bench_setup](https://github.com/AguaClara/fluoride/blob/master/Summer%202018%20fluoride%20report/Bench%20setup.png?raw=true)
Figure 1:

Explain your apparatus setup using enough detail such that future teams can recreate your apparatus. Make sure to explain why you built it this way.
* Design (calculations, constraints)

  $\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$
* Schematic (label parts)

* Image (from lab; label parts)
* Materials (dimensions, materials)
* Complications in construction
* If already constructed: write a brief summary of important constraints, include any revisions to apparatus, also reference the prior report where construction is described


### Procedure
Discuss your experimental procedure. How did you run your experiment? What were you testing? What were the values of relevant parameters?

## Results and Analysis
Present an observation (results), then explain what happened (analysis).  Each paragraph should focus on one aspect of your results. In that same paragraph, you should interpret that result.  
In other words, there should not be two distinct paragraphs, but instead one paragraph containing one result and the interpretation and analysis of this result. Here are some guiding questions for results and analysis:

When describing your results, present your data, using the guidelines below:
* What happened? What did you find?
* Show your experimental data in a professional way.
```python
from aide_design.play import*
x = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
y = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
plt.figure('ax',(10,8))
plt.plot(x,y,'*')
plt.savefig('/Users/jillianwhiting/github/Jillian-Whiting/Images/linear')
plt.show()
```
![linear](https://github.com/jillianwhiting/Jillian-Whiting/blob/master/Images/linear.png?raw=true)
Figure 1: Captions are very important for figures. Captions go below figures.

After describing a particular result, within a paragraph, go on to connect your work to fundamental physics/chemistry/statics/fluid mechanics, or whatever field is appropriate. Analyze your results and compare with theoretical expectations; or, if you have not yet done the experiments, describe your expectations based on established knowledge. Include implications of your results. How will your results influence the design of AguaClara plants? If possible provide clear recommendations for design changes that should be adopted. Show your experimental data in a professional way using the following guidelines:
* Why did you get those results/data?
* Did these results line up with expectations?
* What went wrong?
* If the data do not support your hypothesis, is there another hypothesis that describes your new data?

## Conclusions
Explain what you have learned and how that influences your next steps. Why does what you discovered matter to AguaClara?

Make sure that you defend your conclusions with facts and results.

## Future Work
Describe your plan of action for the next several weeks of research. Detail the next steps for this team. How can AguaClara use what you discovered for future projects? Your suggestions for challenges for future teams are most welcome. Should research in this area continue?

# Manual
The goal of this section is to provide all of the guidance that would be necessary for a future team to pick up your work where you left off. Please try to be thorough and put yourselves in the shoes of a newcomer to the project. Below are some recommended sections, but the manual will likely take a slightly different form for each team.

## Fabrication Details
Include any information related to the fabrication of equipment, experimental apparatuses, or technologies. Include the purpose of each step and the fabrication methods used. Reference appropriate safety precautions.

## Experimental Methods
### Set-up
Step 1.
* Put tasks in a sequential order.
* It is okay to have sub-lists.
  - Like this.

### Experiment
Step 1.

### Cleaning Procedure
Step 1.

## Experimental Checklist
Another potential section could include a list of things that you need to check before running an experiment.

## ProCoDA Method File
Use this section to explain your method file. This could be broken up into several components as shown below:

### States
Here, you should describe the function of each state in your method file, both in terms of its overall purpose and also in terms of the details that make it distinct from other states. For example:
\begin{itemize}
\item \underline{OFF} - Resting state of ProCoDA. All sensors, relays, and pumps are turned off.
\end{itemize}

### Set Points
Here, you should list the set points used in your method file and explain their use as well as how each was calculated.
