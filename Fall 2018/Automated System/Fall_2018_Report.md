[Hi fluoride auto, my comments will be in brackets.]

[You all were only supposed to do the first few sections, so I don't know why you have everything else here or whose report you took all it from, but its evident you never read through it. This draft was fine but I hope the next one will be more of your own work. (RESOLVED)


## Abstract
The Fluoride Auto subteam [state which fluoride subteam you are (RESOLVED)] seeks to develop a sustainable, inexpensive fluoride removal system for implementation in upcoming AguaClara plants in India. Using the apparatus developed in previous semesters, the team continued running experiments testing how various concentrations of PACl affect fluoride removal. The team then analyzed the variability of the Langmuir isotherm generated by the summer 2018 Fluoride team. This analysis factored into the overarching goal of developing a model to predict an optimal coagulant dosage given both influent and target effluent fluoride concentrations.

## Introduction
With 85.0% of its drinking water sourced from groundwater, India is the largest user of groundwater in the world. In stark contrast to tap water sources in the United States that are supplemented with fluoride, India’s groundwater sources often display excess levels of fluoride due to rocks in aquifers that leak large amounts of fluoride into the water. Consequently, villagers  who rely on these well sources for water are at a high risk of overexposure to fluoride. The prevalence of dental fluorosis, an indicator of excessive fluoride concentrations, differs across India, but has been shown to range from 13-91 percent depending on the age group in question and the water source supplying the state or municipality [(Arlappa et al., 2013)](http://www.ijrdh.com/files/11.Fluorosis.pdf).

In accordance with AguaClara's mission to create affordable, reliable, and sustainable water treatment solutions, the goal of the subteam is to treat groundwater with excessive fluoride concentrations. Teams from previous semesters analyzed the efficiency of fluoride removal by passing a coagulant, polyaluminum chloride (PACl), and a solution of fluoride through a sand filter. However, the sand filter was an inefficient method of removal because of the buildup of headloss from particles deposited in the sand filter that eventually prevented water from flowing through [(Dao et el., 2015)](https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/AGUACLARA/Fluoride). Thus, instead of using a traditional sand filter, the team researched a similar relationship between PACl and fluoride via a floc blanket reactor. Flocs are aggregates of particles that are created through collision and precipitate out into the water. In the floc blanket reactor, flocs of PACl and clay adsorbed the fluoride from the influent water. The flocs then overflowed into a floc weir as the floc blanket grew and the purified water flowed out the top of the reactor. This reactor was modeled after the floc blanket, floc weir, and plate settlers setup in the sedimentation tank of a typical AguaClara water treatment plant. The team expected that the floc blanket reactor would be able to remove fluoride with a significantly higher efficiency than the sand filter from previous semesters and could run for extended periods of time due to the absence of headloss buildup in the reactor. The flocs in the floc blanket could exit the floc weir while the fluoride in the sand filter would build up and saturate the sand in a short amount of time [(Longo et al., 2016)](https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/AGUACLARA/Fluoride) [(Cheng et al., 2016)](https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/AGUACLARA/Fluoride).


This is the first semester of the Fluoride-Auto subteam. The main goal thus far has been to analyze fluoride removal by researching and constructing Langmuir isotherms. Langmuir isotherms are used to explain adsorption mechanisms. They are based upon the assumptions that there are a fixed number of adsorption sites and each site can hold one adsorbed molecule. This team has fit a Langmuir isotherm to previous data obtained in Fall 2017 and Summer 2018 by the Fluoride-Gravity subteams. After discovering issues with various data points, the Langmuir isotherm plots were constructed with the removal of some data points. Once the Langmuir isotherm is verified, the information can be applied to other dissolved species removal teams in AguaClara.

##Literature Review
####*Fluoride Limitations and Hazards*

Over-consumption of fluoride can lead to arthritis, dental fluorosis, crippling fluorosis, bone deformation and ligament calcification [(Roholm, 1937)](http://cof-cof.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Roholm-Fluorine-Intoxication-A-Clinical-Hygienic-Study-Copenhagen-Denmark-1937.pdf). Fluoride can cause irritation through inhalation, digestion, and touch, and can cause damage to both eyes and exposed skin [(NJ Department of Health, 2010)](http://nj.gov/health/eoh/rtkweb/documents/fs/1699.pdf). Though there isn’t an established average level of fluoride in India, literature suggests that fluoride levels are seldom above 5 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$ in groundwater. However, in the remote Karbi Anglong district of India, fluoride levels range from 5-23 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$ causing severe anemia, stiff joints, painful and restricted movement, mottled teeth and kidney failure [(LeChevallier and Au, 2004)](http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/9241562552/en/).

According to the National Research Council (NRC), the maximum contaminant level (MCL) of fluoride in drinking water is 4 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$. However, a secondary limit of 2 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$ has been established by the EPA to avoid potential cosmetic effects such as tooth and skin discoloration. The World Health Organization (WHO) established a safe upper limit of 1.5 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$ to avoid all potential risks of fluoride consumption. The team will be striving towards the WHO guideline of 1.5 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$ of fluoride this semester by designing and experimenting with the floc blanket reactor and manipulating the ratios and concentrations of PACl and clay in the system.


####*Polyaluminum Chloride (PACl) and Fluoride Removal*
One common type of water treatment consists of a series of coagulation, flocculation, and clarification. During coagulation, raw water is mixed with a positively charged coagulant (typically an aluminum salt or iron salt), altering or destabilizing any negatively charged particles or dissolved and colloidal contaminants [(EPA, 2016)](https://iaspub.epa.gov/tdb/pages/general/home.do). Depending on the dose of coagulant, there are two methods of particle destabilization. The first, charge neutralization, occurs with a lower coagulant dose and happens as the negative colloids are attracted to the positively charged coagulant particles. The second method, sweep flocculation, requires a high coagulant dose and transpires when the contaminants are caught by precipitates as they settle in the suspension [(EPA, 2016)](https://iaspub.epa.gov/tdb/pages/general/home.do). The destabilized particles then proceed through flocculation, where additional mixing increases the rate of particle collision, forming larger precipitates. Following the formation of flocs, clarification removes the agglomerated particles through sedimentation or other removal processes [(EPA, 2016)](https://iaspub.epa.gov/tdb/pages/general/home.do).

In recent years, polymerized forms of aluminum salts have been used increasingly to replace standard aluminum salt coagulants [(Ingallinella and Pacini, 2001)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10934529.2011.598835?scroll=top&needAccess=true). Polyaluminum chloride, a partially hydrolyzed aluminum salt, is one of the most widely used, as it delivers results similar to aluminum sulfate (alum) coupled with a polyelectrolyte [(Ingallinella and Pacini, 2001)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10934529.2011.598835?scroll=top&needAccess=true). The main advantages of using polyaluminum chloride instead of alum include a reduction in sulfates added to treated water, lower sludge production, reduced odor problems, and higher overall removal efficiency [(Gebbie, 2001)](http://wioa.org.au/conference_papers/2001/pdf/paper6.pdf). In the Daylesford Water Filtration Plant, a dose of 45 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$ of alum was required to produce potable water, while only 12 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$ of  PACl were required. Additionally, PACl is advantageous in particulate removal because its hydrolyzed state allows for it to be less affected than typical aluminum salts when temperature conditions are inconsistent [(EPA, 2016)](https://iaspub.epa.gov/tdb/pages/general/home.do). Furthermore, PACl has a broader range of raw water pH in which it is an effective coagulant. It shows stable turbidity removal from 5.0-8.0 pH, compared to a range of 6.0-7.0 pH for both $\rm{AlCl_3}$ and $\rm{Al_2(SO_4)}$  [(Yang et al., 2010)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20188465). For the removal of fluoride, PACl has been found to be the most effective with pH values between 5.2 and 6.2 [(EPA, 2016)](https://iaspub.epa.gov/tdb/pages/general/home.do).


Many sources have shown that PACl seems to be the optimal coagulant for the purposes of removing  fluoride from influent water. [(Zonoozi et al, 2009)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19381000). PACl has been and continues to be used as the most common form of dye removal at the industrial scale. Despite its cost, a main reason as to why PACl is so popular as opposed to other coagulants is that PACl does not cause any leeching of hazardous chemicals into the water from dye decomposition [(Golob et al, 2005)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143720804002724). A drawback of PACl is that once its coagulation capabilities are saturated, the dye coagulation drops drastically while other coagulants are able to reach a maximum capacity and plateau. The team has been using PACl as the coagulant since the start of the project. Therefore the reasons listed above the team will continue to use PACl as its choice of coagulant for experiments. A future experiment may be to optimize choice of coagulant in order to maximize flouride removal, but other more important parameters must be optimized before approaching this issue.


Several techniques currently use PACl to reduce high fluoride levels. The Nalgonda technique is a popular fluoride removal method that involves a combination of rapid mixing, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration and disinfection. However,  fluoride removal is usually done through co-precipitation  [(Bailey and Fawell, 2004)](http://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/43514), which has traditionally been done using aluminum sulfate, but more recent experiments have proven that PACl can be an effective substitute [(Kumbhar and Salkar, 2014)](http://www.ijetae.com/files/Volume4Issue10/IJETAE_1014_22.pdf). The Nalgonda technique typically utilizes a "batch filtration" method, where large quantities of water are treated in buckets. This technique does not utilize continuous flow, and requires a series of treatments to obtain decontaminated water for extended periods of time. For this reason, the Nalgonda technique has been largely introduced as a household treatment method, and has been introduced to various Indian villages, including those in Nalgonda and in the state of Telangana. It is also currently being studied at the pilot scale in Kenya, Senegal and Tanzania [(Dahi et al., 1996)](https://wedc-knowledge.lboro.ac.uk/resources/conference/22/Dahi.pdf).  In addition to the restrictions implied by batch treatment, the Nalgonda method requires a high dosage of aluminum sulfate to aggregate with fluoride and precipitate. A study conducted by [(Dahi et al., 1996)](https://wedc-knowledge.lboro.ac.uk/resources/conference/22/Dahi.pdf) suggests that 13 $\mathrm{\frac{g}{L}}$ alum (1.2 $\mathrm{\frac{g}{L}}$ as Al) is needed for the Nalgonda method to effectively treat fluoride levels between 9 and 13 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$. Despite the high concentrations of coagulant, the fluoride residual in the test was still unable to meet the WHO safety guidelines of 1.5 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$ of fluoride. The high dose of aluminum sulfate also leaves high sulfate residuals in the water, which causes taste and odor issues [(Bailey and Fawell, 2004)](http://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/43514).


In regards to other filtration methods, a study by Inganiella achieved 33.3% removal of fluoride using a combination of a gravel pre-filter and a sand rapid filter to capture granules of fluoride, PACl, NaClO and $SO_4H_2$ [(Ingallinella and Pacini, 2001)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10934529.2011.598835?scroll=top&needAccess=true).


####*Floc Blankets*
Floc blankets develop when vertical flow sedimentation tanks form a fluidized bed of particles like the one in the figure below that then facilitates particle removal by “increasing particle-particle interactions that lead to flocculation and filtration occurring in the floc blanket” [(Hurst, 2010)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.849.6127&rep=rep1&type=pdf).

Figure 1: Floc blanket forming in the reactor
</div>

The process of forming flocs requires both the precipitation of aluminum hydroxide from the coagulant and the contact with raw water colloidal particles [(Hurst, 2010)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.849.6127&rep=rep1&type=pdf). Once the combination of precipitation and mixing forms small particles, these new flocs collide to form larger, more porous flocs that can then be used for clarification [(Hurst, 2010)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.849.6127&rep=rep1&type=pdf).

This floc blanket clarification is considered hindered settling, which is a form of sedimentation [(Gregory et al., 1996)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-61196-4_2). Sedimentation processes are characterized by the removal of suspended particles, e.g. flocs, sand, and clay, from water. Removal is possible due to the differences in density between water and the suspended particles, but is also dependent on the size of the suspended particles, water temperature, turbulence, stability of flow, bottom scour, and flocculation [(Sun, 2004)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/0471623571.ch11/summary). Floc blanket clarification, however, is primarily driven by upflow velocity of the water and by floc concentration, while the other parameters show a weaker correlation with the creation of the floc blanket. [(Gregory et al., 1996)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-61196-4_2). The relationship between upflow velocity, concentration and water quality can be combined into the mass rate of settling, which is equal to the product of upflow velocity and concentration. Within a range of mass fluxes, a distinct interface is established between clear water and the floc blanket and thus one can deduce appropriate values of velocity and floc concentration.  At concentrations above that ideal mass flux range, the aggregation of flocs becomes thick enough that compression settling occurs, which refers to when over a quarter of the volume of the coagulant will enter the floc blanket within an hour. At concentrations below that appropriate range, flocs are not inhibited by other particles and a suspension with different settling velocities is formed [(Gregory et al., 1996)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-61196-4_2).

Examples of floc blanket clarification are shown throughout the world as further proof of its potential in water purification. In Taiwan, a process of pre-sedimentation, floc blanket clarification, and sand filtration is used to reduce 100 NTU water down to potable levels [(Lin et al., 2004)](https://ascelibrary-org.proxy.library.cornell.edu/doi/abs/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9372(2004)130:12(1481)). Floc blankets have also been used extensively to purify water of algae, protozoa and specific virus strains [(LeChavallier and Au, 2004)](http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/9241562552/en/). Therefore, it is believed that the adaptability of this method in conjunction with the use of PACl would allow for effective fluoride removal.

[I know that this is the literature review from the last 1424545 senesters but I wonderif it even needs to be this long, if you all run out of work you could try to condense it. (We did not run out of work)]

## Previous Work
In the Spring of 2016, the team determined that the sand filter system was inefficient and decided to move towards the idea of a single floc blanket reactor [(Longo, 2016)](https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/AGUACLARA/Fluoride). Although the sand filter provided cheaper, more adequate removal of fluoride per milligram of PACl used, a key issue that arose with the sand filter was the system run time. The sand filter became saturated with PACl and fluoride too quickly and the head loss built up rapidly. In a matter of a couple of hours, the floc blanket was completely saturated to the point where it was no longer efficient or providing adequate removal of fluoride. Consequently, the system had to be backwashed too frequently to be an effective process (about every couple hours). On a much larger scale, such as a full size plant, the level of maintenance required to backwash each sand filter would be infeasible. In order to address this, the team fabricated a new reactor as seen in Figure 2 mirroring that of the floc blanket and plate settlers in the current AguaClara plants. The team set up a new apparatus fit with stock tanks, a reactor, a turbidimeter, a flocculator, and stock and waste pumps, referencing research  previously conducted on the relationship between the amount of coagulant added and head loss accumulation [(Dao, 2015)](https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/AGUACLARA/Fluoride).

Figure 2: Pump Powered Setup
</div>

The Spring 2016 team then developed a MathCad file to calculate flow rates of pumps from a given set of parameters including upflow velocity, tubing diameters, and reactor concentrations. The team also created a ProCoDA method file to turn the flow rates into RPMs for the pumps so that the process of changing PACl and fluoride concentrations within the reactor was more user-friendly. Transitioning the MathCad file completely to Python is still underway, but might not be necessary if our gravity powered setup is successful.


After the calculations and fabrication were completed, the Spring 2016 team was able to successfully create a floc blanket composed of clay and PACl. When the floc blanket had stabilized, the Spring 2016 team tested the system with fluoride. By performing short term, 10 hour tests, the Spring 2016 team was able to remove around 85% of the initial concentration of fluoride. The final concentration of fluoride in the effluent was lower than the WHO regulation, indicating that the floc blanket reactor was a viable method to remove fluoride [(Longo, 2016)](https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/AGUACLARA/Fluoride).

In an effort to visualize the formation of floc blankets, the Spring 2016 team fabricated an entirely transparent version of the reactor, where the important contact points (the floc weir and the bend to the tube settler) were visible so that interactions occurring in those areas could be analyzed. The Spring 2016 team then used this reactor at an EPA competition to analyze red dye in place of fluoride and found that it was a successful dye removal apparatus. Red dye was used in place of fluoride for the majority of testing since red dye is cheaper and easier to see in the reactor and red dye and fluoride have similar properties in how they are removed and adsorbed to PACl. Once satisfactory removal efficiency was achieved, the Spring 2016 team switched to using fluoride to determine more accurate conclusions. Finally, the Spring 2016 team performed some initial jar tests which suggested that the use of clay may not be necessary for the removal of fluoride [(Longo, 2016)](https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/AGUACLARA/Fluoride). These tests included putting PACl and fluoride into a beaker to mix for 5 minutes then settle for 15 minutes. Then, the surface water was tested for fluoride to reveal low levels of fluoride.


In the Fall of 2016, the team fabricated a new bottom insert to prevent the accumulation of flocs that clogged the bottom of the reactor. The newly fabricated geometry with a smooth sloped bottom  as shown in Figure 3 allowed for gradual flow expansion and the recirculation of the flocs that would have settled to the bottom of the reactor with the old bottom geometry.

Figure 3: Bottom insert geometry that prevented clogging of the reactor
</div>

Various concentrations of dye were tested (from 25 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$ to 100 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$) using a 1:1 PACl to dye ratio to see whether higher concentrations of dye would clog the reactor. However, even though increasing the concentration of dye increased the density of the floc blanket, the reactor did not clog and the bottom insert proved to be successful for these tests [(Longo, 2016)](https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/AGUACLARA/Fluoride).

The team also determined the minimum length of the reactor needed to save resources and space. A shorter reactor, with a height of 5 cm below the weir, was tested with concentrations of 25 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$, 50 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$, and 100 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$ of dye. Although the floc blankets reached a short term steady state height of around 20-30 cm,  the reactor failed in the long term as flocs built up and went through the tube settler to the turbidimeter.[this sentence says "long term" twice][RESOLVED] This suggested that there was a minimum height that a floc blanket would reach; thus the shorter reactor system was not feasible. [(Longo, 2016)](https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/AGUACLARA/Fluoride).

During the final portion of the semester, the subteam performed 24-hour experiments with the longer reactor in order to compare its results with those of the CSFBR subteam. The CSFBR subteam had hypothesized that a species removal system composed of two reactors in series could lead to cleaner water than the Fluoride team's single reactor system. During each iteration, the two teams ran each system for approximately twenty four hours with the same red dye and PACl concentrations. However, the results of these experiments were inconclusive because the CSFBR team found that PACl would clog their system midway through each experiment; rendering the reactors incapable of further purification [(Dokko, 2016)](https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/AGUACLARA/Countercurrent+Stacked+Floc+Blanket+Reactor?preview=%2F327614518%2F340898600%2FCSFBRFinalReportFall2016.pdf). Thus, past semesters' CSFBR subteams sought to reexamine the benefits of reactors in series versus a single reactor and to conclude which system yields the lowest effluent concentrations of red dye and fluoride.

Over the summer of 2017, tests performed during the previous semester were repeated in order to finally determine whether the second reactor in series made enough significant improvements to be implemented on a larger scale. A new fluoride probe was purchased, and experiments conducted on this probe showed that a plant using Spring 2017 Fluoride subteam's parameters could produce effluent water with as low as 0.05 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$, significantly below the WHO's standards. However, clay that remained in the effluent caused turbidity to often rise above 5 NTU. In consideration of this turbidity and as an effort to lower the number of resources needed to implement the reactor, it was determined that clay needed to be eliminated from the system. Additionally, the unusually high PACl dosage of 25 $\mathrm{\frac{g}{L}}$ needed to be lowered. While no data was collected that definitively pointed to using one or two reactors, the team tentatively hypothesized that the second reactor would not justify the added expenses when built on a larger scale. However, once the reagent parameters were optimized, further tests and a cost analysis could be conducted to verify this.


As research conducted during the summer of 2017 suggested that [last semester's team? Did you all even read this] removed the addition of clay to the system and sought to determine the optimal PACl concentration for high fluoride removal rates [(Longo, 2017)](https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/AGUACLARA/Fluoride). Initial tests showed that the reactors would fail within 10 hours due to sludge buildup regardless of PACl concentration, so the team switched to a new reactor designed by the summer 2017 High Rate Sedimentation team. The new reactor increased the time to failure and allowed for higher upflow velocities. After running various tests, the team determined an upflow velocity of 1.5 $\mathrm{\frac{mm}{s}}$ was the best way to reduce sludge buildup. The team then ran experiments looking at  the effects of increasing PACl concentration on removal rates. Data collected from these experiments was used to create an adsorption model that could be used to calculate the necessary PACl dosage for a desired effluent fluoride concentration.

Figure 4: Langmuir Model Comparison to Experimental Data
</div>

After creating the adsorption model, the team observed a significant difference in the fluoride probe readings for tap water versus the readings in deionized water. The findings suggested that the amount of fluoride ions in tap water is actually higher than the readings from the fluoride probe state. Therefore, the team decided the adsorption model was incorrect and should be remade taking this discrepancy into consideration.

In the spring of 2018, the team worked to confirm the isotherm developed in the fall of 2017. During the fall of 2017, the team worked to confirm that a change from deionized water to tap water in the creation of standards to calibrate the fluoride probe would not affect readings. The team also confirmed that the fluoride probe had developed problems accurately measuring the concentration of fluoride. Therefore, the team sent the probe back to the manufacturer for repairs and ordered a new probe in case repairs were unsuccessful. While waiting for a new probe, the team began the fabrication process of a gravity powered model for fluoride removal.

Experiments were conducted with a new fluoride probe in the Spring of 2018, which measured the effluent concentrations of fluoride after treatment with different concentrations of PACl. (When a new probe was ordered, the difference in voltage readings between tap and DI water were negligible; therefore, it was concluded that the discrepancy last semester may have been caused by a probe issue) The results are summarized in the table below.

Table 1: A summary of the experimental results using the fluoride probe . Initial fluoride concentrations, as well as PACl concentrations were varied to pinpoint an optimal coagulant concentration for fluoride removal.
</div>

The goal of both the Fall 2017 and Summer 2018 team was to measure different effluent concentrations of fluoride with the probe for different concentrations of PACl to construct an adsorption model. This model would be used to predict the PACl dosage needed for a desired effluent fluoride concentration and would also give an adsorption density value for the mass of F- adsorbed. Since the desired fluoride level set by the WHO is 1.5 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$, this is the desired effluent fluoride concentration. Therefore, the model would calculate a range of uptake values that would result in the target effluent concentration. Additionally, the model would calculate the PACl dosage necessary to treat an initial fluoride concentration given the range of W values.
At a certain maximum PACl dosage, the Summer 2018 team found that the reactor would clog due to insufficient shear to break down the PACl flocs, thereby causing the bed to fluidize.  If the adsorption model calculates an excessive PACl dosage, a second reactor would be necessary to decrease the max concentration of PACl necessary to run the system. This will be shown again in experiments run in the Fall of 2018, where gel systems were formed at high PACl concentrations.

However, the Summer 2018 team found that results were inconclusive. For example, influent concentrations of 10 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$ and 5 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$ of fluoride resulted in the same fluoride effluent concentration of around 3 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$ for 12.5 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$ of PACl and around 2 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$ for 25 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$ PACl. It is unlikely that the same dosage of PACl would result in the same effluent fluoride concentration for fluoride inlet concentrations that differ by a factor of 2.  Therefore, another more accurate probe should be ordered before any definitive conclusions can be drawn.

The Summer 2018 team began experiments with the new probe delivered in May. Coagulant dosing was changed based on the isotherm developed during the spring of 2018, which showed that coagulant dosing at 6.25 mg/L will not create a floc blanket. The coagulant dosing ranged from 10 mg/L to 50 mg/L with the influent fluoride concentration ranging from 3 mg/L to 20 mg/L. The team also identified that the influent fluoride concentration did not match the ideal concentration set by the flow rate and stock tank concentration. Therefore, the team began to take a manual reading of the influent fluoride before it reached the flocculator to compare to the effluent fluoride reading. These manual readings were used by the Fall 2018 in the Langmuir isotherm dervation.

## Results [Whose results are these?][RESOLVED-JHS]

The initial challenge for the Fluoride Auto Fall 2018 subteam was to analyze the variability of the Summer 2018 and Fall 2017 Langmuir Isotherm. A Langmuir isotherm was developed from the Summer 2018 and Fall 2017 data. Generally, adsorption occurs when gas or liquid particles, in this case, fluoride, adhere to binding sites of an adsorbent, in this case, PACl. This forms of a thin film on the surface of the adsorbent as the weak chemical reaction between Fluoride and PACl takes place, as follows:

$\ F + PACl \rightarrow F-PACl$

A Langmuir Isotherm models operates under two assumptions:
1. Each binding site on the PACl molecule is chemically equivalent
2. Each Fluoride molecule can only adhere to one binding site

The uptake is defined as the amount fluoride adsorbed over the mass of the adsorbent, PACl. This describes the adsorption density, and is defined as follows:

$\ W = \frac{initial fluoride - final fluoride}{mass coagulant}$

As the concentration of effluent fluoride increases, W decreases because the adsorbent reaches its capacity, $\q_m $, where no more fluoride can bind to the coagulant.

W was calculated for the experimental data from the Summer 2018 and Fall 2017 teams. A nonlinear regression method was used to compare a theoretical Langmuir Isotherm model to the experimental data. Values for $q_m$ and the adsorption reaction equilibrium constant were guessed, and W was calculated using these guessed values. The difference between uptakes was then summed, squared, and minimized using Excel's Solver function while varying the Langmuir parameters. This technique gave ideal parameters, and was used to graph a theoretical Langmuir isotherm that was plotted against the experimental data, as follows:

The experimental data fits the Langmuir isotherm closely, specifically at low fluoride concentrations, which shows that the adsorption model is an accurate fit. The coefficient of determination is 0.82, which shows that a high percentage of variability in the uptake is from the variability in the concentration. However, there are two data points that do not fit the theoretical isotherm. The team looked into why these two points deviated from the fit, and determined that the root cause is experimental error. More data collection is necessary to confirm the Langmuir model, but the team concluded that a necessary PACl concentration can be predicted from Fluoride concentration with this model.

Current experiments have been run at high PACl concentrations. (Tigran- talk about gel formation and add some pics)
Work during this semester has been aimed at reducing the variability of data points. One method that was proposed for reducing variability was by introduction of a new bottom geometry. Work in the Summer of 2018 found that flocs aggregate at the bottom of the reactor. Addition of a new geometric piece, was theorized that can force flocs to flow along parallel paths. Without a singular point for flocs to collide, a large amount of flocs will not accumulate at and flow upwards within the reactor. A CAD file of this design is shown below.

This design is based on the principle that any constriction of the pipe's diameter must be done with linear flow profiles. So we can see two different contractions of the radius of the reactor is done through linear profiles all at 60 degrees as recommended by Dr. Monroe Weber-Shirk. Since we are using linear wedges the inlet ends with a square which is shown in below. In inlet tube is a circle so a perfect fit is not possible from the inlet tube to the bottom of the geometry. Flow is still achieved when incorporating the novel bottom geometry. Experimentation with this new bottom geometry has resulted in gel formation and failure of the experiment.

Gel formation is indicative of gel suspension occurring and the formation of a super saturated solution. Gel was formed throughout the entire reactor for the first experiment, which was run with 40 mg/L PACl and 10 mg/L fluoride. To combat the formation of gel and to attempt to form flocs instead two theories were tested. First, that the concentration of PACl was too high and second, the ratio of fluoride to PACl was too high. During prior semesters, experiments were run with up to 50 mg/L of fluoride without gel formation so this does not seem to be the issue. Secondly, Dr. Weber-Shirk proposed that with too high of a concentration of fluoride bound to PACl. Aluminum bound to fluoride may possibly repel other aluminum particles within solution. While past teams have conducted experiments at higher fluoride concentrations, very few experiments were conducted at concentrations of 10 mg/L or higher. The last theory for the consistent of gel formation for this semester's experiments is that inclusion of the bottom geometry promotes formation of gel. Below are two pictures of gel formation. Dye was injected to visualize where the gel was during the second experiment since the gel was not present throughout the entire reactor.

Due to the flow of the dye through the reactor, the team concluded that gel first formed in the floc hopper and grew until it reached the top of the reactor. The full reach of the gel is shown in the image on the left while figure 8 shows the gel after flushing the rest of the reactor with a high flow rate of water. When using 8 mm/s upflow velocity gel breaks up quickly within the main reactor. Gel within the floc weir is harder to break since it is controlled by a single speed pump. In order to stop gel formation within the floc weir the team must further understand what parameters stop the accumulation of PACl of flocs but instead promote formation of gel.

##Conclusion

The Fall 2018 Fluoride Auto subteam has concluded thus far that the Langmuir isotherm model fits previous experimental data with low variability. The team has also concluded that the current reactor setup leads to uniform gel formation. The bottom geometry was inconclusive in its overall effectiveness and may even possibly be causing gel formation. Further experimentation and research must be conducted to understand the flocculation and gel formation occuring within the team's setup.

## Future Work

The next steps include validating the Langmuir isotherm model, determining the root cause of gel formation and eliminating it, and exploring whether floc blanket formation is necessary for fluoride removal. The team will first observe the change in gel formation by lowering the PACl concentration or adjusting the reactor bottom geometry. Then, the team will run more experiments to determine floc blanket effectiveness and if a new design of the reactor is required where a floc blanket does not form. Further experimentation must be done with the new bottom geometry working with the High Rate Sedimentation subteam to understand if this bottom geometry is causing the formation of gel. Finally, the team will confirm the Langmuir model by running more experiments at varying PACl and Fluoride concentrations.

## Fabrication Details
###Reactor
The reactor in the system as shown in Figure 8 was developed by the summer 2018 Fluoride Gravity subteam. Details on how to construct it may be found [here](https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/AGUACLARA/High+Rate+Sedimentation).

</div>

###Set-up
The apparatus the team is currently running experiments with is uses a basic flocculator-settling tube design. Coagulant, and water are pumped into the flocculator, and the pumps are controlled by ProCoDA. The Fluoride pump is not controlled by ProCoDA so we manually set the flow rate before each experiment. The pumps all pump through the flocculator and the outlet of the flocculator enters the bottom of the sedimentation tube. Ideally, flocs in the sedimentation tube will recirculate as fluid flows up the tube, and if the floc blanket gets large enough, flocs will fall down the floc weir. The outlet of the sedimentation tank goes into the in-line fluoride concentration bottle, and then flows into the turbidimeter and then into the sink. ProCoDA measures data at constant time intervals for voltage, and turbidimeters.


####Protocol for Running Just Water Through the Reactors

1. Open tap water valve and close the fluoride valve as to not pump fluoride into the system during backwash
2. Close the waste line
3. Turn on Just Water process in ProCoDA and fill system completely with water.
4. Make sure the sample bottle with the fluoride probe does not overflow from the high flow rate of the water
5. Continue to run water until turbidimeter reads less than 0.5 NTU and fluoride concentration is less than 0.5 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$.
6. Record the initial voltage reading to make sure the initial concentration of fluoride in the sample bottle is about 0 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$

####Protocol for Start Up and Running of Reactors
1. Fill stock tanks with appropriate concentration of PACl, and fluoride
hours
2. Calculate the flow rates of the PACl, water and fluoride pumps from the MathCAD file and run the pumps at the appropriate RPM using ProCoDA
3. Run the waste pump at the appropriate RPM as calculated from ProCoDA.
4. Calibrate the fluoride probes and record the initial concentration of fluoride in the sample bottle
5. Place the fluoride probe into the in-line concentration measurement bottle

####Experimental Checklist:
#####Before starting test
1. Waste line is open (System will explode if this is not open)
2. No leaks anywhere in system
3. Pumps are all turned on and running at the correct RPM (Check ProCoDA)
4. Pumps are all pumping water in the correct direction (in the direction of the flocculator and reactor)
5. Put ProCoDA into the "Run Experiment" mode
#####During test
6. Recheck everything periodically to ensure it is running how it should be and that there are no water leaks. Make sure liquid in the continuous fluoride measurement bottle doesn't overflow.
#####End of test
7. Change the process to the OFF state.
8. Clean the reactor using the "Cleaning  Procedure" after the experiment is completed.

####Cleaning Procedure
1. Put a piece of sponge in the tube between the flocculator and PACl insert.
2. Run a high velocity jet through the tube to purge the flocculator of excess clay buildup.
3. Drain the reactor through the valves at the bottom.
4. Flush water through the system.
5. If there is not a noticeable amount of floc blanket buildup, (a) and (b) can be skipped.

####Fluoride Probe Calibration Procedure
1. Make the stock calibration concentrations of .1 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$, 1 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$, 10 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$, and 20 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$ in small bottles. Individually pipette fluoride stocks into all four bottles, do not use serial dilutions.
2. Rinse the fluoride probe with DI water and carefully dab the end of the probe on a Kimwipe. If any sediments from prior experiments remain, rub off with polishing
3. Insert the probe into one of the calibration solutions.
4. Swirl the probe around, then let it settle. Record the voltage once it reaches a steady state
5. Make sure to record the voltage at the minimum voltage (the voltage will spike first and eventually reach a steady state voltage before increasing again).
6. Repeat with the other fluoride concentrations and record the values in Google Docs (labeled "Fluoride Calibration").
7. The R squared value, slope, and y-intercept will be updated as the voltages are updated (make sure the R squared value is at least .99 to ensure accurate fluoride calibrations).
8. If R squared value is not 0.99 or higher, rinse the probe and let it settle in 5 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$ solution for 5 minutes, then rinse thoroughly with DI water. Repeat procedure.

###ProCoDA Method File

ProCoDA is a process control system that was developed by Monroe Weber-Shirk in order to set process parameters through a computerized system. It can be adjusted to different system states that control the system pumps depending on what flow rates are desired. Additionally, ProCoDA collects the data from probes, allowing for compilation of dye concentration data.

To begin the ProCoDA method file, four states were made: ON and OFF, Just Water and Run Experiment. In the OFF state, all the valves were closed and no pumps were on. In the ON state, all the pumps were ON and all valves were opened, in the Just Water state, only the water valve was open. ProCoDA turned this pump on and off via a normal valve control, so long as the pump was already set to a proper flow rate. In the Run Experiment state, the pump flow rates are updated to proper values and shut off after 4 hours of testing.

The method file was set to control the revolutions per minute (RPM) of the PACl/dye pump and the tap water pumps. This was done using the peristaltic pump ProCoDA file available in the AguaClara server as well as inputs for desired flow rate and tubing size. For the PACl and fluoride pump heads, inputs of $\mathrm{\frac{mL}{rev}}$ and flow rate were needed to calculate RPM since microtubing was used, and for the water pump head, tubing ID and flow rate were needed to calculate RPM. The set points used for the method file included a water pump set point for the water pump RPM and a floc pump set point for the PACl/dye pump RPM.
