# Fluoride

## Introduction: 
Fluoride contamination of groundwater is a major, well-known health concern, that still does not have any highly effective or sustainable technologies to remedy it. The World Health Organization suggests the Nalgonda method, but this technique has several major flaws including a treatment efficiency that is limited to only 70 percent, and a large dose of aluminum sulfate, which causes sludge disposal problems. Instead, we use Polyaluminum Chloride (PACl) as a coagulant to which the fluoride can both adsorb to and coprecipitate with.The goals of the Fluoride Team is to design and create the optimal system for adsorbing and coprecipitating out fluoride from groundwater.
