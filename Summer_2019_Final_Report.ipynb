AguaClara's mission of providing access to safe drinking water for all has motivated the AguaClara team to expand and develop new goals to provide safe drinking water from groundwater sources. By considering and analyzing the differences in drinking water collected from groundwater sources in other regions around the world and the needs associated with these sources, AguaClara can serve a broader range of communities around the world who are deprived of access to safe drinking water.\n",

        "At some locations where there is little to no fluoride in drinking water, fluoride is added in for the purpose of strengthening teeth and deteriorating natural deposits [(NYC DEP, 2016)](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/pdf/wsstate16.pdf). However, there are detrimental consequences when there is an excess concentration of fluoride in the water being consumed by inhabitants in the area. For example, there has been moderate to high fluoride pollution in regions such as Algeria, Thailand, Ghana, India, and Iran, whose major source of drinking water comes from groundwater sources. The pollution of groundwater in these regions is due to the mobile dissolution of fluorite, apatite, and topaz from weathered rocks, increasing the levels of fluoride in the groundwater [(Bhattacharya and Samal, 2018)](http://www.isca.in/rjrs/archive/v7/i4/6.ISCA-RJRS-2018-028.pdf). The effects of consuming excess fluoride include dental, skeletal, developmental, neurological, endocrine, reproductive, and carcinogenic issues that affect the health of the communities in areas of high fluoride concentrations [(Bhattacharya and Samal, 2018)](http://www.isca.in/rjrs/archive/v7/i4/6.ISCA-RJRS-2018-028.pdf). Therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) regulated the concentration limit for fluoride in drinking water to be 1.5 mg/L [(Water-related diseases, 2016)](https://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/diseases-risks/diseases/fluorosis/en/). However, more than 65 million Indians consume drinking water above the recommended limit of 1.5 mg/L and some locations in India contain up to 20 mg/L, which risks the health of many communities [(LeChevallier and Au, 2004)](https://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/9241562552/en/).\n",
        "\n",
        "The AguaClara team aspired to achieve the recommended limit of 1.5 mg/L or lower stated by the World Health Organization. The gravity system was the one tested with the implications that it could one day be implemented on-site for fluoride removal in the communities with excess concentrations of fluoride. The automated system was tested moreso to investigate optimal conditions for fluoride removal in an AguaClara reactor and the feasibility of the design. Nevertheless, the Fluoride team tested both the automated apparatus and the gravity-powered apparatus with PACl and fluoride to optimize fluoride removal to achieve residual concentration of less than 1.5 mg/L. If the gravity-powered fluoride removal apparatus were to operate successfuly in the optimal conditions of removing fluoride to a concentration of 1.5 mg/L, feasibility analysis on site would be performed to test whether the system can be used in the communities in India, which would allow AguaClara to provide access to safe drinking water in India and other locations that obtain water from groundwater sources."

        "Groundwater in some developing countries, including India, is contaminated by industrial waste and geological deposits that often contain fluoride. If ingested in high concentrations over an extended period of time, fluoride can pose serious health concerns. While fluoride concentrations of 1.0 mg/L to 1.5 mg/L in drinking water are generally considered safe and can even help improve dental enamel in children, levels above 1.5 mg/L can cause dental and skeletal fluorosis ([Jagtap et al, 2012](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/cr2002855)). \n",
        "\n",
        "Fluoride levels are generally found to be below 1.5 mg/L in seawater, rivers, and lakes, but tend to be much higher in groundwater sources, especially in areas where minerals containing fluoride are located in abundance ([Fawell et al, 2006](https://books.google.com/books?id=7xu1yf-OC8oC&lpg=PR5&ots=f1CYqkjcYO&dq=fluoride%20drinking%20water&lr&pg=PA6#v=onepage&q=fluoride%20drinking%20water&f=false)). Thus, the presence of fluoride poses an especially significant risk in regions that obtain much of their drinking water from underground aquifers. In rural India, for example, approximately 80% of water used for drinking comes from groundwater sources ([Jagtap et al, 2012](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/cr2002855)). A study by Brindha et al. that was carried out in India’s Nalgonda district found groundwater concentrations of fluoride as high as 8.8 mg/L, and determined that only around 52% of the water sampled was safe to drink ([2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10661-010-1348-0)).\n",

Therefore, the AguaClara Fluoride team aims to reduce effluent fluoride to a concentration below this standard of 1.5 mg/L.\n",

        "###Polyaluminum Chloride (PACl) and Defluoridation\n",
        "One method of defluoridation for drinking water is a system that implements coagulation, flocculation, and sedimentation. Coagulation is a process that involves adding a positively charged chemical coagulant to the raw, untreated water. Once the coagulant has been sufficiently flocculated, or mixed, it begins to destabilize colloidal and dissolved particles in the raw water ([EPA, 2007](https://oaspub.epa.gov/tdb/pages/treatment/treatmentOverview.do?treatmentProcessId=1934681921)). The coagulant that is often used for defluoridation of water is polyaluminum chloride, or PACl, with the chemical formula Al2(OH)3Cl3 ([Gebbie, 2001](http://wioa.org.au/conference_papers/2001/pdf/paper6.pdf)). PACl is a better choice of coagulant in comparison to other common coagulants such as aluminum sulfate, or alum, because of its ability to treat water in a larger pH range of around 5.0 to 8.0 in contrast to alum’s effective pH range of around 5.5 to 6.5. Additionally, the absence of sulfate in PACl prevents the buildup of hydrogen sulfide in wastewater, which has been known to corrode pipes and other components of the sewer system. Both PACl and alum lead to residual aluminium in the effluent water, which must then be removed to meet the 0.2 mg/L standard set by the Environmental Protection Agency. The usage of PACl, however, tends to result in less residual aluminium, which further supports using PACl as the coagulant for fluoride removal instead of alum ([Dubey et. al, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167732218303490)).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "After PACl is added to raw water, the molecules attract dissolved fluoride ions and the mixture enters the flocculation stage of treatment. In flocculation, the destabilized particles from coagulation are encouraged to agglomerate together to form \"flocs\". There are several ways to instigate the agglomeration of these particles, with some common methods being a gentle mix, or a baffled plug-flow reactor ([EPA, 2007](https://oaspub.epa.gov/tdb/pages/treatment/treatmentOverview.do?treatmentProcessId=1934681921)). The goal during the period of flocculation is to maximize the probability of particle interaction between destabilized matter so that these species of interest will form flocs in the reactor that have a higher density than the water around them. To reiterate, \"Aggregation requires successful collisions. Success is defined by particles attaching when they collide\" ([Weber-Shirk et al, 2018](aguaclara.github.io/Textbook/index.html)). These successful collisions allow for the removal of fluoride in the sedimentation process, where the agglomerated particles are separated from the water using gravity settling or other clarification methods ([EPA 2007](https://oaspub.epa.gov/tdb/pages/treatment/treatmentOverview.do?treatmentProcessId=1934681921)). \n",

        "\n",
        "Floc blankets are formed in tanks where water is fed downwards into a hopper-shaped geometry displayed in Figure 1. The water is then redirected upwards, which resuspends floc particles that have settled to the bottom of the tank so they can agglomerate into a fluidized layer of flocs in the tank ([Garland et al, 2016](http://doi.org/10.1089/ees.2015.0314). This collection of flocs, or blanket, typically rises to a point that is controlled by some type of weir or other means of particle separation from the treated water ([Gregory 1977](https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/22645/2/Gregory-R-1977-MPhil-Thesis.pdf)).\n",

        "  </center>\n",
        "\n",
        "Using a floc blanket for particle removal is beneficial because, as water travels upwards through the blanket, there is an increased chance of collisions between remaining particles in the water and the particles in the floc blanket; particles in the water are then more likely to be captured by the floc blanket instead of escaping with the clean effluent. While this process greatly increases removal efficiency, it should be noted that the floc blanket does not capture all particles, because of shear forces acting on smaller flocs that prevent them from remaining attached to larger flocs.\n",
        "\n",
        "The stability and quality of the floc blanket depends on both the settling velocity of flocs and the upflow velocity through the sedimentation tank ([Su et al, 2004](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135403005025)). For this reason, it is important that these two aspects are controlled carefully. Studies have shown that when one of these parameters experiences fluctuations, floc blankets can fail to function as intended, which may subsequently lead to poor effluent water quality ([Su et al, 2004](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135403005025)). In one case, a clarifier in Taiwan lost its entire floc blanket during a period of low turbidity measurements in the influent raw water ([Lin et al, 2004](https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%290733-9372%282004%29130%3A12%281481%29)). Furthermore, the conditions must be maintained to allow for the resuspension of agglomerated flocs into the fluidized bed, but not to a superfluous degree where flocs would be torn apart by high shear forces ([Garland et al, 2016](http://doi.org/10.1089/ees.2015.0314)).\n",

        "Kaolinite clay was introduced into the fluoride system to investigate its usefulness as an indicator for flocculation. When fluoride flocs form with PACl, the resulting solids are clear and can only be seen when closely examining the sedimentation tube with a flashlight. It was hypothesized that by introducing clay after the flocculator, there would be some interaction between the fluoride flocs and the clay that would involve fluoride flocs adhering to clay particles and thereby becoming more visible. Furthermore, flocs that contain clay and PACl tend to be larger than those containing fluoride and PACl, which was thought to improve removal of the flocs during sedimentation ([Savenko 1999](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023%2FA%3A1010496606751.pdf)). Research has shown that clay can also play a role - especially in groundwater applications - in the adsorption of fluoride and other pollutants of interest ([Savenko 1999](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023%2FA%3A1010496606751.pdf)). Savenko claims that, when paired with certain aluminum coagulation processes, each gram of clay added has been able to absorb up to 3.3 mg of fluoride ([1999](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023%2FA%3A1010496606751.pdf)).\n",

        "The AguaClara Fluoride Automated System began in Fall 2016 after receiving an EPA Phase II grant in Spring 2016 [(Cheng et. al., 2016)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bzej1vulT_XyWHZyLXdIWlk1RkE/view). The team focused on using PACl for particle removal using only a floc blanket. The team ran tests with red dye in place of fluoride so that turbidity and visual observation could be used to gauge particle removal. The team determined that the floc blanket must be at some minimum height greater than 5 cm for effective removal of red dye. In addition, a sloped bottom geometry for the base of the sedimentation tube was fabricated to prevent the settling of flocs at the bottom of the reactor and subsequent clogging. The main goal of this new bottom geometry was to remove any flat horizontal surfaces so that flocs that reached the bottom would have to recirculate instead of settling. \n",
        "\n",
        "The 2017 teams used clay in the system, but stopped using clay after observing high levels of turbidity in the effluent. Using high levels of PACl (25 mg/L), the team was able to produce an effluent with a concentration of as low as 0.05 mg/L [(Longo et. al., 2017)](https://github.com/AguaClara/Fluoride-Auto/blob/master/Spring%202017/Fluoride%20Spring%202017.pdf). Additionally, initial tests were conducted with both single and multi-reactor systems, but the single reactor system was ultimately chosen after taking large-scale cost and labor into consideration [(Longo et. al., 2017)](https://github.com/AguaClara/Fluoride-Auto/blob/master/Fall%202017/fluoride-fall-2017.pdf).\n",
        "\n",
        "The Spring 2018 team ran experiments in which they either changed the influent PACl concentration or the influent fluoride concentration; in order to collect data for the developing Langmuir Isotherm, an adsorption model was thought of to describe the interaction between polyaluminum chloride and particles in the water such as red dye or fluoride ions [(Akpan et. al., 2018)](https://github.com/AguaClara/Fluoride-Auto/blob/master/Spring%202018/FluorideReportSp18.md). Skepticism over the accuracy of the probe led to somewhat inconclusive data.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Summer 2018, the team concentrated on continuing to run experiments to gain more data to plot against the Langmuir Isotherm [(Pang et. al., 2018)](https://github.com/AguaClara/Fluoride-Auto/blob/master/Summer%202018/Fluoride_Summer2018.md). The team plotted uptake, or the mass of fluoride removed per the mass of influent PACl, against the effluent fluoride concentration and concluded that PACl was effective in removing fluoride from the influent water, even if an optimal dosage of PACl had not yet been determined.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Fall 2018 team experienced the significant obstacle of gel buildup in the reactor [(Mehrabyan et. al., 2018)](https://github.com/AguaClara/Fluoride-Auto/blob/master/Fall%202018/Automated%20System/Fall_2018_Report.md). Functioning floc blankets should be a fluidized bed of particles that are constantly recirculating, while gel is a mass of flocs that tend to adhere to the side of the reactor and do not recirculate. The reoccurrence of gel in most of the experiments caused early failure due to blockage of the floc weir entrance and the ensuing escape of flocs through the effluent tubing.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Spring 2019 team continued the task of testing different ratios of PACl to fluoride and plotting the data of previous semesters against the Langmuir Isotherm [(Sausele et. al., 2019)](https://github.com/AguaClara/Fluoride-Auto/blob/master/Spring%202019/Fluoride-Auto-Spring-2019-Report.md). The team added a flow accumulator in the system to prevent pulsing. The data from Spring 2018 to Spring 2019 is shown in the Results and Analysis section. The Spring 2019 team also transitioned from using MathCAD for determining experimental flow rates to using Python, which is currently being used for experimental calculations as well as graphing and data analysis. \n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, the Spring 2019 team ran tests to see if the fluoride probe could detect fluoride in the form of flocs. High-turbidity samples of effluent that contained flocs were measured with the fluoride probe. After filtering the samples through mesh, their concentrations were measured again. The team found significant percent increases in measured fluoride concentration after filtering, which led to the conclusion that the mesh helped break up the flocs into a form that the probe was able to detect."

These constant head tanks control flow rates through the system: the Fluoride Constant Head Tank drives the upflow velocity in the sedimentation tank while the PACl Constant Head Tank drives the PACl flow rate and dosage. The PACl and fluoride constant head tanks have float valves that allow for a constant volumetric flow through the system, which can then be calculated by measuring the output volume over time [(Pang et al., 2018)](https://github.com/AguaClara/Fluoride_Gravity/blob/master/Fall%202018/Fluoride_Grav_Fall2018_Report.md).\n",

        " * **Addition of the Flow Accumulator in the Automated System:** Early on in the summer, the team observed pulsing in the influent water tube, which continued in the flocculator and sedimentation tube. Thus, the team implemented the Flow Accumulator, which is a bottle with both an influent and effluent opening. The bottle is filled with water just enough to cover these openings, then capped tightly in order to allow the air pressure inside the bottle to facilitate the flow of water out of the bottle, free of pulsations from the pump.\n",
        " * **Increased Angle of the Sedimentation Tube:** In previous semesters, the team used a sedimentation tube with a bend that was 60° from the horizontal. In the initial tests that the Summer 2019 team ran, flocs seemed to be accumulating above the floc weir, on the plate settlers. The team then increased the angle of the bend to 70° in an attempt to allow flocs to slide down the plate settlers more easily and thus prevent the build up of flocs above the floc weir.\n",
        " * **Uniform Reactor for Automated and Gravity System:** In the Spring 2019 semester, the Automated and Gravity systems used sedimentation tubes that were uniform in angle (the bend was 60° from the horizontal) and lengths. However, the systems differed in their placement of the floc weir. While the Automated system floc weir was on the vertical part of the sedimentation tube (Figure 5),  the Gravity system floc weir was above the bend of the tube (Figure 6). The Automated team also connected a 1 RPM waste pump to the floc weir to remove flocs. The Summer 2019 decided to use two sedimentation tubes with the same specifications in order to be able to compare experiments done on both systems. Thus, the team fabricated two sedimentation tubes with a bend that was 70° from the horizontal and a floc weir above the bend instead of on the vertical part of the sedimentation tube. The Summer 2019 team also decided not to include the waste pump in the system, as gravity proved to be sufficient for flocs to exit the weir. Finally, the Spring 2019 Automated and Gravity teams used different bottom geometries, but after initial testing, a working bottom geometry was determined and implemented in both systems.

An essential characteristic of a properly working floc blanket is continuous recirculation of flocs. Gels form when a large accumulation of flocs builds up so much that the flocs within it are unable to recirculate or move, and other separate flocs are forced to flow through a path around it rather than through it. The Summer 2019 team, like the Fall 2018 team, defined any buildup of gel, whether in the bottom of the reactor or on the plate settlers, to signal failure in the system.\n",

However, previous fluoride teams used an upflow velocity of 1.5 mm/s to graph points on the Langmuir Isotherm to prevent gelling in the tube. One of the goals from the Spring 2019 Automated team was to figure out if there was possibly an optimal upflow velocity between 1 mm/s and 1.5 mm/s that was low enough to ensure that the floc blanket could form properly but high enough to prevent gel from building up in the sedimentation tube. \n",

However, after observing the flocs gelling on the plate settlers in many of the experiments, the team decided to try a higher upflow velocity to see if it would change the outcome of the experiment. Both with and without clay, the team ran qualitative experiments in the Automated and Gravity systems to see how the floc blanket would behave if the upflow velocity was higher than 1 mm/s.\n",

The team proceeded to troubleshoot the system, starting with the water pump. The output of the pump was measured volumetrically and the team determined that the number of mL of water pumped out for each revolution of the pump's rotors was not 0.8 mL/rev as indicated by the tubing size, but was instead 1 mL/rev. The implication of this discovery was that the tests believed to be run at 1 mm/s since the beginning of the summer had actually been running at around 1.32 mm/s. The team documented this change for future reference. Additionally, the Gravity system ran at a slightly slower 1.17 mm/s throughout the summer, with comparable results. Thus, the team believes that a range of upflow velocities can work for fluoride removal, and will continue to explore this idea in future semesters to determine a reasonable range."

For example, on July 11 the team ran an experiment in the Automated system with flow rates that had not previously gelled, but gel built up throughout the tube and on the plate settlers. However, after making a fresh solution of PACl, the team stopped observing gel for the rest of the experiments that week. Thus, the team hypothesizes that the possible oxidation of PACl or some other interaction between PACl and species in the air may have caused the PACl to function less effectively as a coagulant. While the PACl Stock Tank was covered at all times to prevent evaporation, it was still not in a completely air tight chamber. The team will continue to investigate this hypothesis going forward.\n",

Several times after running high-velocity water from the sink through the bottom geometry the system would stop gelling, which indicates that a congested bottom geometry or influent tube to the sedimentation tube may also prevent the formation of a proper floc blanket or cause a gel from the beginning of the sedimentation process.\n",

A reactor concentration of 18.9 mg/L of PACl was used in the Gravity system, while 30-40 mg/L of PACl was used in the Automated system. When the team tried to implement a higher concentration of 30.1 mg/L of PACl in the Gravity system in order to reach a closer concentration to the one used in the Automated system, gelling was observed. Another variable was the upflow velocity; the Gravity system had been running at around 1.17 mm/s while the Automated system had been running at around 1.32 mm/s. The team believed that the upflow velocity in the Gravity system was too low and possibly facilitating the formation of gel at the higher PACl concentration, so the upflow velocity was increased to around 1.55 mm/s (the team still needs to improve the method of adjusting heights and upflow velocities with more precision in the Gravity system). However, despite this higher upflow velocity in the Gravity system, gel was still observed from the beginning of the floc blanket formation. Thus, the team concluded that the Gravity system is more sensitive to PACl dosages, and aims to understand in future semesters why the same PACl concentration in the Automated reactor behaves differently from the Gravity reactor."

        "### Introducing Clay into the System\n",
        "A few weeks into the summer semester, the team began to think of a different approach of removing fluoride. As aforementioned, fluoride in both its ionic and floc form is nearly invisible and in the lab requires a flashlight held against the sedimentation tube in order to view the floc blanket. One hypothesis was that clay would both increase the turbidity of the flocs and possibly help the flocs settle rather than exiting the tube with the clean effluent water.\n",
        "\n",
        "The team decided to try adding clay into the system, with the goal of increasing the visibility of the fluoride flocs to both the turbidimeter and to the naked eye. Additionally, since clay particles are more massive than fluoride particles, the team hypothesized that the addition of clay would increase the mass of the flocs and thus allow the flocs to fall into the floc weir more easily rather than continuing to build up past the floc weir as they had been in experiments conducted before the addition of clay. The clay pump was added after the flocculator so that the fluoride would have sufficient time to bind with the PACl in the flocculator and not have to compete with the clay particles. Because of the placement of the pump, the team set a timer for 5 minutes after starting each experiment before turning on the clay pump, to give the fluoride and PACl time to make it through the flocculator before adding clay. The residence time of the flocculator, when using an upflow velocity of 1.3 mm/s as the team had been doing, is actually around 1.9 minutes, so the first flocs entered the tube as just fluoride and PACl and no clay.\n",
        "\n",
        "The addition of clay to the fluoride system was not a completely new change to the AguaClara fluoride removal research. The Spring 2016 team added clay to their system but decided that it was not a necessary component because it caused the effluent turbidity to rise and did not aid in the removal of fluoride, by their standards. \n",
        "\n",
        "The previous section details the attempts to understand the fluoride probe and ensure that the effluent fluoride is in a form that the probe can sense. However, the point of adding the clay was to try a different way of gauging success, by tracking turbidity rather than effluent fluoride concentration. The team observed an increase in turbidity while cleaning out the system and sending a large number of flocs through the effluent, but a significant increase in turbidity was not seen during regular experiments even when flocs were seen exiting through the effluent. At this point in the semester, the team is still unsure of the effect that the flocs have on turbidity. In comparison, the previous fluoride teams observed a much more definite and concrete increase in effluent turbidity when adding clay to the system. Thus, the Summer 2019 hypothesis was that the clay would bind to the fluoro-aluminum complexes and make the nearly clear flocs more turbid, which could then be used as an indicator for failure or success. An increase in turbidity could mean that fluoride was also escaping and would thus signal failure.\n",
        "\n",
        "The team compared experiments done with and without clay using the same dosages of PACl and fluoride and observed that using clay did not significantly increase the fluoride uptake per amount of PACl used as seen in Figure 15.

The fluoride sedimentation tubes since Fall 2016 all used 1\" inner diameter PVC for the sedimentation tube and plate settler and 3/4\" inner diameter PVC for the floc weir. However, the choice to use a thinner tube for the floc weir was originally an arbitrary fabrication decision, so the team decided to see how a larger weir would affect the removal of flocs.\n",

The team hypothesized that the tee was not bent perfectly, and instead introduced a flat surface on which flocs could settle and eventually form a gel. Therefore, the team may in the future use a wye to fabricate a sedimentation tube in order to eliminate flat surfaces and make the fabrication of sedimentation tubes more uniform. \n",

However, these new tests proved to be inconclusive, as many of the samples showed an insignificant increase in the concentration reading following filtration. The team is still unsure of why the results are so different from those in Spring 2019; one possible reason is that the probe used in Spring 2019 was nearly at the end of its life cycle and may not have been as accurate as it could have been, whereas the Summer 2019 team purchased a new probe at the beginning of June.\n",

The team used a horizontal reactor from a previous team to test a water velocity of 1 mm/s, 2 mm/s, and 5 mm/s.

        "A closed system was tested to observe how flocs and fluoride concentration would behave in a closed batch system. A jar configuration was set up as described in the Procedure section, and then different concentrations of PACl were added to a 5 mg/L solution of fluoride. The most notable observations occurred when PACl was added and stirred into the solution for 10 seconds only, and then allowed to sit for 7 minutes, with the fluoride probe measuring continuously. It was observed that the change in fluoride concentration happened in the first few seconds when the solution was being mixed, and then the concentration leveled out for the remainder of the period before measurement. This can be seen by the behavior of the fluoride probe, shown below in Figure 38. This graph shows two additions of PACl, both occurring at the spikes. After these spikes, the voltage levels out in a few seconds. This signifies the short mixing period and subsequent period of settling (note that the higher the voltage on the probe, the lower the fluoride concentration). Based on this data, it was hypothesized that the current length of the flocculator and residence time (around two minutes with an upflow velocity of 1.32 mm/s) may be superfluous. Based on the jar test, the same removal efficiencies can be achieved after only a few seconds of mixing. Figure 39 below shows the actual concentration changing as a function of PACl dosage, with Table 1 providing the corresponding data used to create Figure 39. In reality, all of the fluoride removal happens within 15 seconds of adding the PACl.\n",
        "\n",
        "An instantaneous decrease in fluoride concentration as seen in Figure 39 may suggest that the entire mechanism for fluoride removal may happen in the flocculator (since comparable final fluoride concentrations were observed during the jar test and the sedimentation tube tests). Nevertheless, the instantatneous decrease in fluoride concentration may also indicate that the period of flocculation likely does not need to be as long as it is designed for now. According to Figure 35, the entire flocculation process could take place in the order of 10-15 seconds and adequate removal of fluoride would still be achieved.\n",

        "Based on these tests, it was also confirmed that the fluoride probe does not recognize fluoride in the floc form. This was determined based on the fact that no fluoride left the system, yet a decrease in fluoride concentration was observed as more PACl was added. Table 1 below shows how the fluoride concentration changed as more PACl is added into the system. It was suggested that PACl and fluoride exist in a type of equilibrium where the first dose of PACl adsorbs a large amount of fluoride, but as more PACl is added, some fluoride will break away from the initial flocs to interact with the newly introduced PACl. This was further investigated by comparing data between two trials: the first where PACl was added in 10 mg/L injections and allowed to stir and sit until a total of 50 mg/L was added to the system, and also a dose of 40 mg/L up to 200 mg/L total.

Therefore, the addition of PACl in several additions does not result in more successful fluoride removal than adding the PACl dosage all at once. Another notable observation was that, as more PACl was added past the 40 mg/L dosage, the fluoride concentration continued to decrease. This data could be useful in cases where increasing levels of fluoride are observed and higher levels of PACl may be needed to bring levels below the WHO standard."

        "Although the jar test indicated that adding PACl in small doses did not increase performance, the team hypothesized that the floc blanket in a continuous system might have an effect on the performance of the PACl. Thus, the team converted the jar test setup to a continuous system. As seen in Figure 16 and Figure 17, two sedimentation tubes were connected in series, with a PACl injection between each tube. Initially, there was only a flocculator before the first sedimentation tube, while the tubing between the sedimentation tubes acted as a contact chamber for the flocs to form by diffusion. However, the flocs formed through diffusion appeared different from the flocs formed by flocculation; the diffusion flocs seemed to be less well defined in shape and did not fall down the floc weir like the flocculated ones did. The fluoride removal was also worse without flocculation before the second sedimentation tube, as shown in the graph below in Figure 40, where the steady state fluoride concentration is well above 2.0 mg/L and thus higher than the WHO standard. \n",

        "## Conclusions\n",
        "The Summer 2019 team determined a geometry for the sedimentation tube, with a 160° angle and the floc weir on the plate settler, for which fluoride flocs were seen exiting through the weir. While this single sedimentation tube system did succeed in removing flocs from the water, the effluent fluoride concentration was still above the WHO standard of 1.5 mg/L for many of the experiments. \n",
        "\n",
        "In an attempt to remove more fluoride flocs from the system, the team tried different variations of the system design. The first change was to add clay to the Automated system. This addition of clay did not significantly increase the measured uptake of fluoride by PACl in the system, so the team decided not to move forward with the clay system.\n",
        "\n",
        "The next variation of the system used a wider floc weir than the ones in previous sedimentation tubes. Fabrication errors caused a horizontal surface to remain inside the tee, which the floc weir was attached to, and cause the eventual buildup of gel at the tee even when it originally worked at removing flocs. The uptakes were calculated for this sedimentation tube before failure but did not display improvement from the performance of the sedimentation tube design with the narrower floc weir.\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout the summer, the team wanted to figure out how the fluoride ion selective electrode (ISE) probe works, and if it detects fluoride in the form of flocs or just in ionic form. The jar tests and experiments that logged fluoride concentration and turbidity over time indicated that the probe does not detect fluoride in floc form. Further research into the probe revealed a possible need for a Total Ionic Strength Adjustment Buffer to decomplex fluoride-PACl flocs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Long-term experiments that were allowed to run to steady-state revealed an inverse relationship between effluent fluoride and effluent turbidity, which also further supports the claim that the fluoride probe cannot detect flocs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fabricating a taller sedimentation tube with the ability to grow a taller floc blanket proved to be unnecessary, as the uptakes were not significantly higher than the ones observed with the original-sized sedimentation tube. This test showed that the floc blanket height does not seem to have a correlation with the amount of fluoride removed, and suggests that perhaps the floc blanket does not have to be as tall or even exist in the first place for fluoride removal to be possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "The horizontal reactor, which is meant to not utilize a floc blanket, was tried and abandoned after the repeated formation of gel at the entrance of the sedimentation tube.\n",
        "\n",
        "From the jar tests, the team saw that the binding of PACl to flocs happens in the first few seconds of contact, which may indicate that the length of the flocculator is not as important as it was originally believed to be. Additionally, the jar tests showed that adding the same amount of PACl in several small dosages is not more effective than adding all the PACl to the fluoride solution at once. \n",
        "\n",
        "Using a lab bench with two sedimentation tubes in series confirmed that adding PACl in multiple doses does not increase uptake of fluoride ions. These experiments also showed that the flocculator is necessary in order to form flocs that can properly fall down the floc weir.\n",
        "\n",
        "After plotting the Summer 2019 data and developing a Langmuir Isotherm, it was determined that the model is still feasible for describing coagulant-fluoride interactions but still requires further research and possibly a re-design of the system or the use of a different model in order to increase uptakes and meet the WHO standards."

        "Going forward, the team plans to continue systematically testing different PACl-to-fluoride ratios in order to obtain an optimal coagulant dosage that will lead to an effluent concentration below 1.0 mg/L of fluoride. The influent fluoride concentrations to be tested will be between 1 and 10 mg/L, in order to simulate realistic groundwater conditions ([Rao et.al.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00254-003-0873-3))\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, the team will continue trying different methods of decomplexing the aluminum hydroxyl fluoride complexes that make up flocs. The goal is to ensure that all of the fluoride in the effluent is in the form of ions rather than flocs so that all the fluoride can be detected by the ion selective probe. Once there is a reliable way to consistently decomplex flocs, the team will use a uniform measuring process for experiments going forward.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since it was found that more PACl is possibly needed to treat the influent concentrations of fluoride used during Summer 2019, the team is also beginning to consider the standards for acceptable levels of aluminum in drinking water, since some aluminum from the PACl does escape through the effluent. The EPA-mandated maximum aluminum concentration is 0.2 mg/L. Enough PACl must be dosed in the system to bring the fluoride concentration down to a healthy level, but there cannot be so much PACl that the aluminum concentration rises to an unsafe level. The study by Dubey et al. shows that a filter of 0.2 um may also remove aluminum complexes and remaining flocs, so in the future the team may decide to find a way to measure the level of aluminum in the effluent and employ this filtration step to see if the findings from previous studies can be matched.\n",
        "\n",
        "A redesign of the system is one of the team's main considerations going forward. While the system that uses flocculation and sedimentation removes some fluoride, many of the trials show that it often does not remove enough. The redesign will likely be first tested on the Automated system with pumps and later will be implemented into a gravity-powered system to be used in the field and for further research.\n",
        "\n",
        "In terms of making this process more accessible to a plant operator, the team will continue to explore and discuss ways in which successful treatment of the water can be visibly confirmed, since the fluoride ions as well as flocs are currently clear and difficult to see without a flashlight. The team hypothesizes that adding the clay to the treatment process may increase the turbidity of the flocs and thus give plant operators a concrete way of determining that the effluent water is safe to drink. This hypothesis will be tested within the next few weeks as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite the progress that the AguaClara Fluoride team has made over the past three years, there still remain many unknown aspects of fluoride treatment that must be addressed before the process can be used in the field."
